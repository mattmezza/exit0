exit0
===

🚀 BDD testing for your CLI apps, in pure bash!

`exit0` it's a lightweight, pure Bash lib designed for Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD), making your tests super readable!

What does it do? 🤔 It helps you test your CLI app in a clean, isolated
environment (a subshell) and checks three crucial things:

- What it prints to your screen (STDOUT) ✍️
- Any error messages it throws (STDERR) 🚨
- If it finished successfully or crashed (exit codes) ✅❌

The name `exit0` is a little wink 😉 to the `0` exit code that signals success
in the Bash world!

Also, it is a play on the Spanish word "éxito" which means "success".

## ✨ Why You'll Love `exit0`

Here's a quick peek at why `exit0` is awesome:
- minimal dependencies (just `grep` and `cat`)
- 🥳 It's pure Bash
  Just one file (`exit0.sh`)! No installs, no complex setup. Just source and go!
- Human-Readable Tests 📖
  Write tests that make sense, even to non-devs. Using
  `when_running` and `then_the_..._should_be` makes your test scenarios clear.
- Comprehensive Assertions 💪
  Check everything from exact output, partial strings, empty errors, to precise
  or comparative exit codes.
- Instant Feedback! 🌈
  The colorful output immediately tells you what passed (✅ green!) and what
  failed (❌ red!).
- Clean Environment Management 🧹
  Handy `setup_test_env` and `teardown_test_env` hooks keep your test workspace
  tidy.🚀 Getting Started is a Breeze!

## Installation 📥

- Download lib.sh and place it in your project's test directory.
  `curl -o exit0.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmezza/exit0/main/exit0.sh`
- Create your test script (e.g., `my_script.test.sh`).

## Test File Example 🧑‍💻

Here's how your test file will look:

```bash
#/bin/env bash

source "./lib.sh"

# Optional: Runs before each scenario
setup_test_env() {
    mkdir -p /tmp/test_project
    echo "Hello World" > /tmp/test_project/greeting.txt
}

# Optional: Runs after all scenarios via run_teardown
teardown_test_env() {
    rm -rf /tmp/test_project
}

scenario "My 'greet' command works correctly"
when_running "/bin/cat /tmp/test_project/greeting.txt"
then_the_exit_code_should_be 0
and_stdout_should_contain "Hello World"

scenario "My 'fail' command exits with an error"
when_running "/bin/false" # A command that always fails
then_the_exit_code_should_be_higher_than 0
and_the_stderr_should_be_empty # 'false' usually doesn't output to stderr

# 👇 Don't forget these at the end of your test file! 👇
run_teardown
report_results
```

📝 Assertion Guide

`exit0` gives you a powerful set of assertions to check your CLI's behavior:

Assertion Function                          |What it Tests  |Description
`when_running` "cmd"                        |execution      |Executes your command and captures all its outputs.
scenario "Name"                             |test block     |Starts a new logical group of related tests.
`then_the_exit_code_should_be 0`            |exit code      |Checks if the command's exit code is exactly what you expect.
`then_the_exit_code_should_NOT_be` 1        |exit code      |Confirms the exit code is NOT a specific unexpected value.
`then_the_exit_code_should_be_higher_than` 0|exit code      |Verifies the exit code is greater than a given number (e.g., failed).
`then_the_exit_code_should_be_lower_than 2` |exit code      |Verifies the exit code is less than a given number (e.g., successful).
`then_the_stdout_should_contain "text"`     |stdout         |Asserts that the command's standard output includes a specific string.
`then_the_stdout_should_NOT_contain` "text" |stdout         |Asserts that the command's standard output DOES NOT include a specific string.
`then_the_stdout_should_be "exact\noutput"` |stdout         |Asserts the standard output matches a string exactly (including newlines).
`then_the_stdout_should_NOT_be "exact"`     |stdout         |Asserts the standard output does NOT match a string exactly.
`then_the_stderr_should_contain "Error"`    |stderr         |Checks if any error output contains a specific string.
`then_the_stderr_should_be_empty`           |stderr         |Ensures there was no output to standard error.

## Chaining Assertions 🔗

You can chain multiple assertions after a single `when_running` call using
`and_the_...` functions (e.g., `and_stdout_should_contain`) for cleaner, more
fluent tests!

## 🔧 Environment Hooks

Manage your test environment like a pro with these lifecycle functions:

Function Name       |When It Runs | What It's For
`setup_test_env`    |At the beginning of each scenario.             |Set up temporary files, directories, or environment variables.
`teardown_test_env` |When `run_teardown` is called (at script end). |Clean up all the temporary resources created during tests.

Important: Make sure to call `run_teardown` at the very end of your test script to ensure `teardown_test_env` runs!

We'd love your help! Whether you've found a bug 🐞, have an idea for a new assertion, or want to improve the documentation, feel free to open an Issue or submit a Pull Request!

## Future Ideas

- Adding support for sending input to commands via STDIN ⌨️.
- More robust error handling in `when_running` for edge cases.
